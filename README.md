This is a quite personal project, done by me to learn how to code with swift and use swiftUI. The program does have some potential for scalable use, and has a novel idea behind it, but at the same time is maybe confusing and of niche use. It is an alarm app that tracks time and is activated before a shower, and it informs the user of when to apply a certain product on themselves (i.e some must be kept for 3 minutes) by alarm noises, as well as when the set timer has ended and thus when to step out the shower. These parameters can be set by the user, as well as them being able to choose among the alarm noises, which are actually soft bird chirping noises put at a high volume.

This program aims to reduce time taken in the shower (saving both water and time) while giving the user the reminder to do their shower-duties during the pre-set time.
